# VCV-Rack-Pure-Data-POC
A silly example of VCV Rack communicating with Pure Data using the VCV Prototype module.

After installing VCV Rack, you need to subscribe to "Autodafe - DrumKit" and "Count Modula".

After installing Pure Data, you need to install Automatonism (see https://www.automatonism.com/).
